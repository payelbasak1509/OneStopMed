**Objective**

“Unified Self Treatment portal” has been developed to address all emergency medical needs from young adults to elderly people. This project’s proposal is based on wide range of User’s survey, I have incorporated functionalities that these users have showed as concern regarding managing Health issues with the help of technology. The Survey showed that young adults find it difficult to manage health issues and end up giving least focus to their health. Elderly people have different needs and expectations, they want to access facilities in a friendly manner and wish to have a health solution that they can access in an emergency situation. Keeping these expectations in mind, I designed the “One Stop Med”, an intelligent application which is would address medical needs of a wide range of users with minimum interaction.

User Case 1: User wants to locate nearest Hospitals.
Steps: User opens the One Stop Med website
           User clicks on “Get Help”
 Expected result: User should be able to locate nearest hospitals and accesses details.
Actual result: Users are able to locate hospitals.
 Test Result: Pass
User Case 2: User wants check diseases based on symptoms.
Steps: User opens One stop Med Website.
           User clicks on “Diagnosis”.
           User selects symptoms.
Expected result: User should be able to look up to diseases with the selected symptoms.
Actual Result: Users are able to see view diseases based on symptoms.
User Case 3: User wants to request refill of medicines.
Steps: User opens One Stop portal.
